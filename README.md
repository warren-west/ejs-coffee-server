# Coffee Server with Express and EJS
An application allowing the user to see a list of coffees, view a single coffee item, login and logout.

## Using:
1. You need to add a `.env` file to the root folder of the project, and it's contents should look like this:
```
PORT=3000
API_URL="https://thoughtful-vagabond-fibre.glitch.me/coffee"
```

2. You need to install the project dependencies with the command:
```bash
npm install
```
